# Aula F87 Pro CLI Controller

**DISCLAIMER: THIS PROJECT DOES NOT REVERSE ENGINEER THE COMPLETE COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL OF THE AULA F87 PRO KEYBOARD. IT IS A SIMPLE SCRIPT DESIGNED TO SEND RGB DATA TO THE KEYBOARD FOR LIGHTING CONTROL. CURRENTLY, THIS SCRIPT HAS NO CAPABILITY TO SAVE CONFIGURATIONS ON THE KEYBOARD ITSELF; ALL EFFECTS ARE APPLIED IN REAL-TIME VIA SOFTWARE.**

A command-line interface (CLI) tool to control the RGB lighting of the Aula F87 Pro keyboard on Linux.

## Limitations

*   **Wired Mode Only:** Currently, this tool has only been confirmed to work with the Aula F87 Pro keyboard when connected via a USB cable (wired mode). Efforts to control RGB lighting in wireless mode (e.g., 2.4GHz or Bluetooth) have so far been unsuccessful.

## Features

*   Set solid colors for all LEDs.
*   Apply a breathing light effect.
*   Turn off all keyboard lights.
*   Run a test sequence to check RGB functionality.
*   Automatically find and save the correct HID interface for RGB control.
*   Manage configuration via `~/.aula_f87_config.json`.
*   Parse color inputs in various formats (named colors, hex codes, RGB strings).
*   List available predefined color names.

## Typical Use Cases

1.   **Dynamic Desktop Color Sync:** Use this CLI tool as a backend for a separate script that monitors your desktop environment's dominant colors (e.g., from your wallpaper or active window). The external script can then call `aula-f87pro --color <detected_color>` to dynamically update your keyboard lighting to match your desktop theme.

2.   **Custom Lighting Effects:** While this tool provides basic effects like solid color and breathing, it can serve as a foundation for more complex custom lighting patterns. If the built-in effects aren't sufficient, you can create your own scripts that repeatedly call `aula-f87pro` with different color arguments in sequence or create new functions to generate unique animations. This will require some programming and tinkering on your part.

## Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python 3.9 or higher
    *   `pip` (Python package installer)
    *   `libhidapi-hidraw0` (or equivalent for your distribution) for `hidapi` to work.
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install libhidapi-hidraw0
        ```

2.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ahorts/aula-f87pro.git
    cd aula-f87pro
    ```

3.  **Install the CLI tool:**
    It's recommended to install in a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install .
    ```
    Alternatively, for an editable install (changes in code are reflected immediately):
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```

### Alternative Installation for Global Access

If you intend to call `aula-f87pro` from other scripts or want it available globally without activating a virtual environment:

*   **Using `pipx` (Recommended for user-level global tools):**

    1.  **Install `pipx`:**
        *   On many systems, especially those that manage Python packages strictly (like Arch Linux, recent Debian/Ubuntu versions), you should install `pipx` using your system's package manager to avoid "externally managed environment" errors.

            *   For Arch Linux:

                ```bash
                sudo pacman -S python-pipx
                ```

            *   For Debian/Ubuntu (if available in repositories, check your version):
                ```bash
                sudo apt install pipx
                ```

            *   If your distribution doesn't package `pipx` or the above methods don't work, you might try the official bootstrap method, but prefer your system package manager if possible:

                ```bash
                python3 -m pip install --user pipx
                ```

        *   After installing `pipx`, ensure its scripts directory is in your PATH:
            ```bash
            python3 -m pipx ensurepath
            ```
            You may need to open a new terminal or re-login for this change to take effect.
    2.  **Install `aula-f87pro` with `pipx`:**
        From the `aula-f87pro` project directory:
        ```bash
        pipx install .
        ```
        This installs `aula-f87pro` in an isolated environment but makes the command available in your user's PATH.

*   **System-Wide Installation (Use with caution):**
    ```bash
    sudo pip install .
    ```
    This makes `aula-f87pro` available to all users but installs it into the system Python environment. This is generally discouraged on systems with "externally managed" Python environments as it might conflict with the system package manager or lead to an inconsistent state. Prefer `pipx` or virtual environments.

##
## Udev Rules for Non-Root Access

To use this tool without `sudo`, you need to set up udev rules to grant your user permission to access the keyboard's HID interface.

1.  Create a new udev rule file (replace nano with your editor of choice):
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-aula-f87pro.rules
    ```

2.  Add the following line to the file:
    ```
    SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", ATTRS{idVendor}=="258a", ATTRS{idProduct}=="010c", MODE="0666"
    ```
    *Note: `MODE="0666"` grants access to all users. For a more secure setup, you can use `GROUP="plugdev"` (or another group your user belongs to) and `MODE="0660"`.*

3.  Save the file and exit the editor.

4.  Reload the udev rules and trigger them:
    ```bash
    sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
    sudo udevadm trigger
    ```

5.  Unplug and replug your Aula F87 Pro keyboard.


* NOTE: If all else fails, you can add a NOPASSWD rule for script execution

## Usage

The primary command is `aula-f87pro`.

**First-time Setup (Finding the Interface):**
```bash
aula-f87pro --find-interface
```
